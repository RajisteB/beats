#### Concept
I was browsing around Behance and Dribble and I am across an interesting design for the Apple Music Beat's headphones site featuring their wireless headphones. I wanted to get some good practice in with HTML and CSS, focusing on positioning and layout so I figured this would be a great project.
Credit goes to [Abishek Garg](https://www.behance.net/abhishekgarg) for the overall design, colors and typography.

#### Tools
1. HTML
2. CSS

#### Issues
No issues. Site is coded for laptop/deskptop screens as there was no design for mobile layout.
